  🧪 Unit Testing


 → Definition:
 =============================================================================================
  We can ensure that our managers work as intended by connecting a machine to their public
  methods or whats also referred to as an API (Application Programming Interface). This allows
  us to test if the overall system behaves as expected no matter what goes on inside.
 
  The great news about Xcode is that it comes pre-built with its own testing team! To make
  this even better they always deliver their results within a few seconds leaving us
  reassured that our code functions as intended and designed.

  It's great to have our very own testing team. Let's try to use it!
