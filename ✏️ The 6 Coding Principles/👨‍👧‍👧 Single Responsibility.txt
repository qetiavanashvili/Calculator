👨‍👧‍👧 Single Responsibility


 → Definition:
 =============================================================================================
   Any type that you create (e.g. class or struct) should only do one thing. It should only
   have one purpose and exist for one reason. You might say that it should only have one
   single responsibility.

   E.g. A networking manager class shouldn't also store data to disk. This would break the
   Single Responsibility principle leaving a class with two main purposes instead of one.
   
   Let's avoid managers that do two things. Let's create types that only do one thing each.
