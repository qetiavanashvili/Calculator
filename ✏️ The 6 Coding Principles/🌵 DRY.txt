   Don't Repeat Yourself
   
   This coding principle reduces the repetition of code, which centralises the logic into one
   place. This is a great idea to help support the future maintenance of the project and lower
   the risk of introducing inconsistencies that may occur if multiple areas had to be
   maintained in parallel.
   
   Now let's think about the opposite scenario. If we had two functions that generated the same
   behaviour then developers must repeat the changes in both locations otherwise the app would
   contain the old behaviour as well as the new behaviour.
   
   By writing our code once and centralising it into one place we avoid such inconsistencies
   and remove any possibility of having such problems.
   
   Let's be smart and try not to generate the same behaviour in multiple locations.
