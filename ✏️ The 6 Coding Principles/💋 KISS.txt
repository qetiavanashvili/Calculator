   Keep It Simple. Stupid 🙈
   
   This acronym is widely used within the iOS industry and is a great topic to discuss at an
   interview. As we continue to increase the complexity of each engineering solution we also
   in turn create more opportunities for things to go wrong. We could also rephrase this
   statement to read: The more moving parts the more potential issues.

   We should always try not to over-engineer each solution and instead write less code,
   more readable code and easier to understand code.
   
   Many negatives exist when over-engineering a solution to construct complex systems, whilst
   no negatives exist when simplifying a solution down to a smaller number of parts.
   
   Let's be smart and keep our ideas simple!
