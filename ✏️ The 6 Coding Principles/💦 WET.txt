   Write Everything Twice
   
⚠️ Do not use this principle. ⚠️
   
   This coding principle is the opposite of DRY. We want to always write DRY code and always
   avoid writing WET code. We don't want to repeat ourselves and we never want to write
   everything twice.
   
   Let's avoid writing things twice where we can.
